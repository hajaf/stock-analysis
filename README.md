###The written analysis has the following:

##Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to expand the current dataset we have for Steve to   include the entire stock market over the last few years   this would entail editing current code which only works for a dozen stocks which would work slowly on thousands of stocks if it works at all 

##Results

#The stock performance 2017

The 2017 stocks performed quite well all except for one (TERP)had a positive return. The stock with the highest being DQ (199.4%) and lowest positive return RUN (5.5%). The stock TERP had a negative return of -7.2% which as compared to other positive returns does not seem as significant

#The stock performance 2018

 In 2018 Most stocks did quite poorly as compare with 2017 with only ENPH and RUN having a positive return of 81.9%and 84.0% respectively meaning only RUN improving with in a positive return. The RUN stock improved from having the lowest positive return to the highest return .TERP did improve as well but only by 2.2% meaning it still had a negative return .DQ which had the highest positive return in 2017 had the lowest negative which is -62.6%.

###Summary

##Run Time (original script and the refactored script.)

According to the images above the original script (timer above) took a shorter time to run that the refactored script (timer Below) this may be due to the fact that the first script is shorter  than the next. It is still possible that the refactored script may still work faster on more stock.

#2018 Run time

 Again according to the images above the original script (timer above) took a shorter time to run that the refactored script ( timer Below) this may be due to the fact that the first script is shorter  than the next. It is still possible that the refactored script may still work faster on more stock.


 ##The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general 

#The advantages of refactoring code are that:

•	It conserves time and energy when done well.
•	If along the way you have deleted the code and have no back up, you can always look back at the original code.

#The advantages of refactoring code are that:

•	with multiple amounts of code, it can be quite confusing 

##The advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script 

#Advantage

•	we can run the original code alongside the refactored code to see the difference 

#disadvantage 

•	having both codes on the same page can be overwhelming and confusing you may edit the  original code by mistake  thinking that it is the refactored code that you were working on
